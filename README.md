# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹
This is my go at the code challenge provided by [Quickly](https://www.helloquickly.com/). I've used Next.js for the frontend and TailwindCSS for styling as well as zod for my validation. I've opted for some pretty new React features with
server actions! This is probably a bit overkill but it was fun to implement and I hope you enjoy it! Please excuse the UI design. I'm not a designer and I'm not very good at it. ðŸ˜…

### Things I would have liked to add or do
I would have liked to have a cleaner form validation system with zod. There were some issues I ran into with refinement that I could not allocate the time to fix.
There's also some general things like animations / transitions and loading skeletons that I would have liked to add, but I didn't have the time to implement them.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
